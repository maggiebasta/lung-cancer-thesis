# Convolutional Neural Networks for the Automated Segmentation and Recurrence Risk Prediction of Surgically Resected Lung Tumors

## Overview 
Welcome to the repository for my undergraduate senior thesis - *Convolutional Neural Networks for the Automated Segmentation and Recurrence Risk Prediction of Surgically Resected Lung Tumors*. This repository contains all of the code used to implement the models and experiments discussed in the thesis. The pipeline is illustrated below. Individual README's are also provided in the segmentation and recurrence prediction components of the repo.
